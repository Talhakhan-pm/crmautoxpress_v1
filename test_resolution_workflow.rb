end

puts "=== RECOMMENDATIONS ==="
puts "1. When 'Accept Delay' is clicked, it should:"
puts "   - Set resolution_stage to 'resolution_completed'"
puts "   - Set dispatcher_decision to 'delay_approved'"
puts "   - Update order status to show delay accepted"
puts "   - NOT process a refund (customer accepted the delay)"
puts
puts "2. The order card should show normal status once resolution is completed"
puts "3. There might be an issue in the accept_delay controller action"
